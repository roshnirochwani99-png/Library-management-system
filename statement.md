Project Title - Library Management System

Problem Statement 
Managing books and members in a small library manually using registers or spreadsheets is time-consuming and error-prone. It becomes difficult to track which books are available, who has borrowed which book, when books are due for return, and which members are active.
This project aims to develop a Library Management System that helps librarians manage books, members, and book issue/return operations through a simple web-based interface.

Scope of the Project
The system will be used by a librarian in a small library (college or private).

The system will allow:
Adding and viewing books
Adding and viewing members
Issuing and returning books

It will be a web-based system with:
Next.js + TypeScript frontend
Python (FastAPI) backend
SQLite database

Target Users
Primary user: Librarian
Secondary user: Library admin / staff
